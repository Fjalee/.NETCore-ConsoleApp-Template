# .NETCore-ConsoleApp-Template
My personal console app template for .NET Core

# About   
* Currently for version .NETCore 6.0   

## How to use   
* `local-appsettings.json`   
    * add `local-appsettings.json` file into the same directory as `appsettings.json`.   
    `local-appsettings.json` is for configuration that should not be pushed into repository (eg. API keys)
